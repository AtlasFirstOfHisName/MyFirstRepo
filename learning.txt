From the Introduction to Linux course, I have gained a solid foundation in using the Linux operating system, 
both through the command line and graphical user interfaces.
I learned how to navigate the file system, manage files and directories, set file permissions, and work with users and groups. 
The course also introduced me to essential commands for system monitoring, package management, and basic shell scripting. 
I now understand the Linux file hierarchy, the importance of processes and services, and how to use tools like grep, 
chmod, ps, and top. Overall, the course has equipped me with the practical skills and confidence to operate effectively 
in a Linux environment.
